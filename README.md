To play Battleships+ game you need to have all .cpp and .h files in a specific folder, then play the game by running "main.cpp" file.
Since I used CLion when coding, other files such as .idea are irrevelant and are not needed as long as you are not using CLion. 
This game offers a set of randomly chosen gifts which is awarded when player successfully hits an enemy ship.

Gift #1: Add a new ship (%10) (4 different ships with different stats and different possibilities to get)
Gift #2: One extra shot (%30)
Gift #3: Enemy loses one shot next round (%20)
Gift #4: Enemy can shoot only once next round (20%)
Gift #5: You get one more full round (20%)

Have Fun in Battleships+ game!
