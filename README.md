To play Battleships+ game you need to have all .cpp and .h files in a specific folder, then play the game by running "main.cpp" file.
Since I used CLion when coding, other files such as .idea are irrevelant and are not needed as long as you are not using CLion. 
Have Fun in Battleships+ game written in C++.
